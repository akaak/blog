<blockquote>Technology is your strategic asset!</blockquote>

If you are working for or with a business, stop for a moment and think about the above sentence. I am passionate about discussing and helping you understand the role of technology and how it could help businesses.
  
Relatively speaking, I may be a late bloomer in certain areas of education, learning, life. But, want to do some catch up now (2015).  

I am a lover of open source. I benefit greatly from many wonderful resources from many people/organizations in the open source realm. In this blog, I want to share my experiences on what I observe, try, and learn. My education, background and experience shape my thinking about technology, business, processes, open source and tools. 

*Tools*  `macbook, vim, git, python, sql/nosql `
