title: Hugo - A great static site generator 
---



This site/blog was initially setup in 2015 using Jekyll. Since then I came across a great new static site generator (SSG) called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is a really cool tool!

After using both Jekyll and Hugo along with a couple of other static site genrators, here are some items that stand out with Hugo:

- Hugo is indeed super fast to run on your local
- Great and simple workflow to setup and work on a site
- Documentation is very good
- A lot of good themes out there
- A LOT of flexibility to work with the site design
