How is this blog built?

This blog is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) + Poole and hosted on Github Pages. The [credits](/credits) page gives more infomation.

There are many options for writing and hosting a blog. But, I wanted to stick with text based blog editing and git based tools to manage my posts and site look and feel. For blogs, it is a good idea to keep the blog as a "static" site. The static sites have some advantages (and limitations) over the dynamic sites. The process to write, publish and manage the blog articles and blog site becomes quite easy with Jekyll and Github pages. With simple set of scripts the workflow to publish a new post can be a very simple process.  

The [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a great way to write blog posts. Jekyll gives the platform to generate the static site. [Poole](http://getpoole.com) gives a suite of posts, templates, and styles for Jekyll. Github Pages, of course, in conjunction with github let me host and manage the blog. 

If you are interested in creating a site like mine, please review [credits](/credits) page or write to me and I will be happy to give you some pointers.
