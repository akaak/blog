title: Your Identity 
---

Your identity comes in many shapes and forms: Resume, Social Media,  LinkedIn, Online Portfolio.

The resume has a standard structure and people use different tools to prepare and format their resume. The most common structural elements are name, summary, experience, education, skills etc. Depending on the field and type of experience people have a good bit of leeway to describe and elaborate on their resume.

The latest that I have seen is the json resume. The folks at <http://jsonresume.org> super simplified the whole resume structuring and formatting process. 

Here is a draft version of my resume: <http://registry.jsonresume.org/akaak>

jsonresume has a simple Commnand Line Interface (CLI). Once you write the resume and publish it gets shown within the jsonresume registry.
